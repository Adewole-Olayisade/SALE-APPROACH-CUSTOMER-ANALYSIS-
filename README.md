SALE APPROACH / CUSTOMER ANALYSIS REPORT
PROJECT SUMMARY: The project's objective specifically focuses on sales approaches. The analysis aimed to address key questions, including the distribution of customers based on different sales methods, revenue spread across states and time, and a recommendation on which sales method to continue based on customer preference and revenue generation. The project utilized data transformation, cleaning, and validation processes, leading to a detailed analysis presented through pivot tables and charts. The key recommendation was to persist with the Email approach, supported by evidence of higher customer preference and consistent revenue generation. The report also highlighted the importance of considering other factors and adapting to changes in customer behaviour and market trends.
CLEANING & VALIDATION OF DATA
Initially, the data was transformed into a table. A meticulous inspection ensued, focusing on filters to identify potential issues such as blanks, duplicates, incorrect spellings, or missing values. Fortunately, the data exhibited minimal errors, devoid of missing values or duplicates. As a validation measure, the Revenue column underwent a conversion/formatting process, ensuring precision to two decimal points and a subsequent change to Naira currency.
ANALYSIS
A dedicated sheet for analysis and visualization was crafted, employing a pivot table as the cornerstone. This pivot table was instrumental in addressing specific inquiries.
QUESTION 1: How many customers were there for each Approach?
Ans: Utilizing a pivot table, the Sales approach per customer ID was scrutinized and subsequently visualized through a pivot chart. The Sales approaches considered were Call, Email, and a combination of both. Analysis conducted (Sales Method on the pivot table's axis with the Count of Customer ID) yielded the following results:
Call:         4962 customers
Email:        7466 customers
Email & Call: 2572 customers

QUESTION 2: What does the spread of the revenue look like overall?
Ans: The revenue distribution spans widely across states. California boasted the highest revenue of ₦176,898.82, while Vermont reported the lowest revenue of ₦2,931.08.
The analysis also shows that New Customers (clients) generated the highest revenue of ₦41,155.34 at week 5 while the Partners (clients) had the lowest revenue of ₦12,856.71 at week 6.

Further analysis discloses the distribution of revenue by each sales method:
Call:          ₦ 236,178.63
Email:         ₦ 725,155.29
Email & Call:  ₦ 472,350.97

QUESTION 3: Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
Ans: Indeed, there were differences in Revenue over time for each approach used. 

The analysis shows that:
Call recorded 16% of total revenue (₦236,178.63)
Email recorded 51% of total revenue (₦725,155.29)
Email & Call recorded 33% of total revenue (₦472,350.97)
The difference is clear, Email recorded the highest revenue while Call recorded the lowest revenue.
